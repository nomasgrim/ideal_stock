# Pwa-Client
### Overview
* Created with create-react-app
* Consumed by the [pwa-server repo]()

### NPM Packages
* @material-ui
* cpx
* react
* react-dom
* react-redux
* react-router-dom
* react-scripts
* react-test-renderer
* redux
* redux-form
* redux-thunk
* socket.io-client

Dev Dependencies
* react-styleguidist
* redux-devtools-extension

### Development

#### Installation: Yarn
```bash
yarn install
```

#### Run locally in browser with hot reloading
```bash
yarn start
```

> Keep in mind that you can run this repo independently from the server repo, but
any action that uses websockets won't work unless you have the server running.

### Testing

Runs with Jest and displays coverage report

```bash
yarn test
```

Jest will look for test files with any of the following popular naming conventions:

* Files with `.js` suffix in `__tests__` folders.
* Files with `.test.js` suffix.
* Files with `.spec.js` suffix.

### Debugging in the Editor

**This feature is currently only supported by [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) and [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/).**

#### Visual Studio Code

Start your app by running `npm start`, and start debugging in VS Code by pressing `F5` or by clicking the green debug icon. You can now write code, set breakpoints, make changes to the code, and debug your newly modified code—all from your editor.

Having problems with VS Code Debugging? Please see their [troubleshooting guide](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-chrome-debug/blob/master/README.md#troubleshooting).

#### WebStorm

You would need to have [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/) and [JetBrains IDE Support](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/jetbrains-ide-support/hmhgeddbohgjknpmjagkdomcpobmllji) Chrome extension installed.

In the WebStorm menu `Run` select `Edit Configurations...`. Then click `+` and select `JavaScript Debug`. Paste `http://localhost:3000` into the URL field and save the configuration.

>Note: the URL may be different if you've made adjustments via the [HOST or PORT environment variables](#advanced-configuration).

Start your app by running `npm start`, then press `^D` on macOS or `F9` on Windows and Linux or click the green debug icon to start debugging in WebStorm.

The same way you can debug your application in IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate, PhpStorm, PyCharm Pro, and RubyMine. 

### Getting Started with Styleguidist

Styleguidist combines a style guide, where all your components are presented on a single page with their props documentation and usage examples, with an environment for developing components in isolation, similar to Storybook. In Styleguidist you write examples in Markdown, where each code snippet is rendered as a live editable playground.
Then, run the following command inside your app’s directory:

```sh
yarn run styleguide
```

After that, follow the instructions on the screen.

### Building for production

```bash
yarn run build
```
Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

### Remaining Tasks

* Add JSDOC
